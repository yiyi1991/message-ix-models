# Carbon emissions intensity of transport fuel use
#
# These values are in GWP-equivalent mass of carbon; not in mass of
# the emissions species.

# Notes:
# - Data are for technologies like ``coal_trp``.
# - In both A and B there were no data for eth_{if}c_trp.
# - Data for A were identical to
#   ixmp://cloned-2021-06-09/MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM_R12_CHN/baseline
# - Units were recorded as "kg / kWa" in A and "???" in B. The former
#   appears to be incorrect:
#   https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php gives
#   CO₂ intensity of natural gas as 52.91 kg / 10⁶ BTU; this is
#   1582 kg / kW·a or 431 kg / kW·a carbon equivalent.
