# “…GCAM's China region. Actually, GCAM assumes an average value of
# ~20500 km/yr for China, which seems too high in my opinion, so I
# revised this value downwards. I made an assumption that the value
# should be 20% lower, an estimate I arrived at based on the
# consideration that GCAM assumes that average annual driving distances
# in the US are 20% lower than what MA3T shows for the average driver
# (19200 in GCAM vs. 25860 in MA3T).
