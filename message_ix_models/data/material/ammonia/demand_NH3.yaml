# Ammonia Technology Roadmap IEA. 2019 Global NH3 production = 182 Mt.
# 70% is used for nitrogen fertilizer production. Rest is 54.7 Mt.
# 12 Mt is missing from nitrogen fertilizer part. Possibly due to low demand
# coming from GLOBIOM updates. Also add this to the residual demand. (66.7 Mt)
# Approximate regional shares are from Future of Petrochemicals
# Methodological Annex page 7. Total production for regions:
# Asia Pacific (RCPA, CHN, SAS, PAS, PAO) = 90 Mt
# Eurasia (FSU) = 20 Mt, Middle East (MEA) = 15, Africa (AFR) = 5
# Europe (WEU, EEU) = 25 Mt, Central&South America (LAM) = 5
# North America (NAM) = 20 Mt.
# Regional shares are derived. They are based on production values not demand.
# Some assumptions made for the regions that are not explicitly covered in IEA.
# (CHN produces the 30% of the ammonia globally and India 10%.)
