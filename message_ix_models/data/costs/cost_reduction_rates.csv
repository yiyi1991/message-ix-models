# Cost reduction in 2100,,,,,,
# ,,,,,,
# Units: %  ,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# Data is copied from Sheet1 in https://github.com/iiasa/message_data/blob/dev/data/model/investment_cost/SSP_technology_learning.xlsx,,,,,,
# There are some manually changed assumptions to the original GEA data in the spreadsheet (can be seen in the spreadsheet as marked in yellow),,,,,,
# The initial copied data can be found in gea_reduction_rates.csv,,,,,,
# This file renames the learning rates from GEAL to low and GEAM to medium and GEAH to high,,,,,,
