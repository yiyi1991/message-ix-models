“Sustainable development pathways achieving Human well-being while safeguarding the climate And Planet Earth”

The SHAPE project introduces the new term **Sustainable Development Pathway** or **SDP** for its scenarios, roughly analogous to SSPs.
The SDPs simultaneously achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030, maintain sustainable development thereafter, and meet the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.

​Data
=====

:file:`data/shape/` contains common data for constructing scenarios.
These data quantify the SDP narratives (see link above) as future projections for certain quantities.
Modeling tools [1]_ should use :func:`.exo_data.prepare_computer` to configure :class:`.SHAPE` to retrieve these quantities and select an appropriate scenario's data for model setup calculations.

.. [1] e.g. the IIASA standalone demand models as well as the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM family of models.

The files include:

:file:`gdp_v*.mif`, :file:`gdp_v*.xlsx`
   Gross Domestic Product.

   Generated by Bjoern Soergel at PIK, using stylized GDP/capita growth rate modifications to represent three narratives from the “Economic paradigm, growth, inequality and finance” section of the SHAPE description.
   The narratives are identified by codes for the IAMC "Scenario" dimension:

   - "innovation": “Cornucopia (market-driven innovation)”
   - "service": “Human Service Economy (managing the global commons)”
   - "society": “A New Public Economy (resilient communities)”

   The files have multiple **versions**:

   - "v1p0" version 1.0.
   - "v1p1" version 1.1.

   The extension :file:`.mif` apparently means "modeling interchange file"; this is a CSV file with semicolon (;) delimiters.

:file:`population_v*.mif`, :file:`population_v*.xlsx`
   Population.

   The values are the same across all SDPs; the single code "all_SHAPE_SDPs" is used for the "Scenario" dimension.

   The values are identical to the SSP1 population projection.

   .. todo:: This is may not be true, because the data differ in some (unspecified) way between version 1.0 and 1.1.
      Locate an accurate description for these data.

   .. note:: If true, this would imply that the same population data could be retrieved with :class:`.SSPOriginal` and underlying files, also stored in the :mod:`message_data` repository; so the files :file:`data/shape/population_*` are duplicates.

:file:`gini_v*.csv`:
   Gini coefficients.
   Generated by Jihoon Min.

   - Normative Gini trajectories that will achieve SDG1 (No poverty) and SDG11 (Reduced inequalities) for **most** countries under the corresponding GDP projections (above), also in a stylized way.
   - Same dimensions as the GDP data.
   - v1.1 uses a slower rate of maximum Gini decrease to alleviate concerns about feasibility.

:file:`urbanization.csv`
   Generated by Alessio Mastrucci.

   Three different codes are used for the "Scenario" dimension:

   - "urb_distr"
   - "urb_green"
   - "urb_tech"

   .. todo:: Describe what these values represent.
