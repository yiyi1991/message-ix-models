Quantities
==========

.. note:: This section currently uses labels pertaining to the :doc:`/project/ngfs` project.
   Features to use other sets of labels are not yet developed.

Data from MESSAGEix-Transport and other models and sources is collected for various projects and activities.
The data to be collected are often specified via a “**template**” for data in “**IAMC format**”.
Among other characteristics, the IAMC format collapses all but a very few concepts into a (long) string called a “**Variable name**” that encodes, among other things:

1. The **concept** and/or specific systematized **measure**, including particular units of measurement.
2. Labels for 1 or more **dimensions** of multiple-dimensional data.
   The names of dimensions themselves are not given, and usually inconsistent labels, dimension order, etc. are used in various places in the same template.
3. **Partial sums** over some or all labels along some dimension(s).

These are accompanied by units and descriptions that carry additional information.
(For a detailed discussion of the issues here and better approaches, see the `iiasa/edits-data <https://github.com/iiasa/edits-data/>`_ repository and `accompanying whitepaper <https://www.overleaf.com/read/npnxbnttgfht>`_.)

One task for the MESSAGEix-Transport reporting code (:mod:`.transport.report`) is to translate from the clear, rigid structure of data in the :mod:`message_ix` core formulation (and :mod:`genno`, which is intended to support such data) to these looser and often ambiguously-defined concepts and categories.
This section explains how such translation works, serving both as a requirements specification for and documentation of the code.

Integrated through legacy reporting
-----------------------------------

As of 2022-04, the :doc:`/api/report/legacy` is still in active use.
One function it performs is **aggregation**: some totals across both transport and other sectors are computed by this code, along with other calculations.

The transport reporting code must compute and store these data before it can be picked up and aggregated.
The variable names must correspond exactly to the variable names expected by the legacy code.
