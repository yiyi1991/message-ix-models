Energy: MESSAGE
---------------

Scope and methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MESSAGE (Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact) is a hybrid energy-economic model that combines a linear programming (LP) energy engineering model with an aggregated macro-economic model (MACRO) which is solved by using a non-linear program (NLP). At its core is a global systems engineering optimization model used for medium- to long-term energy system planning, energy policy analysis, and scenario development (Messner and Strubegger, 1995). The model provides a framework for representing an energy system with all its interdependencies from resource extraction, imports and exports, conversion, transport, and distribution, to the provision of energy end-use services such as light, space conditioning, industrial production processes, and transportation. In addition, MESSAGE links to GLOBIOM (GLObal BIOsphere Model) to consistently assess the implications of utilizing bioenergy of different types and to integrate the GHG emissions from energy and land use.

MESSAGE covers all greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting sectors, including energy, industrial processes as well as - through its linkage to GLOBIOM - agriculture and forestry, for a full basket of greenhouse gases and other radiatively active gases, including CO2 ,CH4 ,N2O , NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO, SO2, BC/OC, CF4, C2F6, HFC125, HFC134a, HFC143a, HFC227ea, HFC245ca and SF6. MESSAGE is used in conjunction with MAGICC (Model for Greenhouse gas Induced Climate Change) version 6.8 for calculating internally consistent scenarios for atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing, annual-mean global surface air temperature and global-mean sea level implications.

MESSAGE is designed to formulate and evaluate alternative energy supply strategies consonant with the user-defined constraints such as limits on new investment, fuel availability and trade, environmental regulations and market penetration rates for new technologies. Environmental aspects can be analysed by accounting, and if necessary limiting, the amounts of pollutants emitted by various technologies at various steps in energy supplies. This helps to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations on energy system development.

MESSAGE's principal results comprise, among others, estimates of technology-specific multi-sector response strategies for specific climate stabilization targets. By doing so, the model identifies the least-cost portfolio of mitigation technologies. The choice of the individual mitigation options across gases and sectors is driven by the relative economics of the abatement measures, assuming full temporal and spatial flexibility (i.e., emissions-reduction measures are assumed to occur when and where they are cheapest to implement).
