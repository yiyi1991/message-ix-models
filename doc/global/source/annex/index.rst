Annex: mathematical formulation
*******************************

This Annex provides a description of the mathematical formulation of MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and its modules.

Note that the “MESSAGE V” module implementation was superseded by the generalized MESSAGEix energy model framework.
See the :doc:`MESSAGEix documentation <message_ix:core>` for a complete description of its formulation.
Although it is not in active use, the older MESSAGE V formulation is preserved here for reference.
