Crop production
----
GLOBIOM explicitly covers production of each of the 18 world major crops representing more than 70% of the total harvested area and 85% of the vegetal calorie supply as reported by FAOSTAT. Each crop can be produced under different management systems depending on their relative profitability: subsistence, low input rainfed, high input rainfed, and high input irrigated, when water resources are available. For each of the four systems, crop yields are calculated at the Simulation Unit level on the basis of soil, slope, altitude and climate information, using the EPIC model (Williams and Singh 1995 :cite:`williams_computer_1995`). Within each management system, input structure is fixed following a Leontieff production function. But crop yields can change in reaction to external socio-economic drivers through switch to another management system or reallocation of the production to a more or less productive Supply Unit. Besides the endogennous mechanisms, an exogenous component representing longterm technological change is also considered.
