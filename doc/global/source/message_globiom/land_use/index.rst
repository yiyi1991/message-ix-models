Land-use (GLOBIOM)
=========
Land-use dynamics are modelled with the GLOBIOM (GLobal BIOsphere Management) model, which is a recursive-dynamic partial-equilibrium model (Havlík et al., 2011 :cite:`havlik_global_2011`; Havlík et al., 2014 :cite:`havlik_climate_2014`). GLOBIOM represents the competition between different land-use based activities. It includes a bottom-up representation of the agricultural, forestry and bio-energy sector, which allows for the inclusion of detailed grid-cell information on biophysical constraints and technological costs, as well as a rich set of environmental parameters, incl. comprehensive AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land use) GHG emission accounts and irrigation water use. Its spatial equilibrium modelling approach represents bilateral trade based on cost competitiveness. For spatially explicit projections of the change in afforestation, deforestation, forest management, and their related CO2 emissions, GLOBIOM is coupled with the G4M (Global FORest Model) model (Kindermann et al., 2006 :cite:`kindermann_predicting_2006`; Kindermann et al., 2008 :cite:`kindermann_global_2008`; Gusti, 2010 :cite:`gusti_algorithm_2010`). The spatially explicit G4M model compares the income of managed forest (difference of wood price and harvesting costs, income by storing carbon in forests) with income by alternative land use on the same place, and decides on afforestation, deforestation or alternative management options. As outputs, G4M provides estimates of forest area change, carbon uptake and release by forests, and supply of biomass for bioenergy and timber. (Fricko et al., 2016 :cite:`fricko_marker_2016`)

The model structure
----
We conduct our analysis using the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM)  (Havlík, Schneider et al. 2011). GLOBIOM is a partial equilibrium model representing land-	use based activities: agriculture, forestry and bioenergy sectors. The model is built following a bottom-up setting based on detailed gridcell information, providing the biophysical and technical cost information. Production adjusts to meet the demand at the level of 30 economic regions (see list of the regions in Table S2). International trade representation is based on the spatial equilibrium modelling approach, where individual regions trade with each other based purely on cost competitiveness because goods are assumed to be homogenous (Takayama and Judge 1971, Schneider, McCarl et al. 2007). Market equilibrium is determined through mathematical optimization which allocates land and other resources to maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus (McCarl and Spreen 1980 :cite:`mccarl_surplus_1980`). As in other partial equilibrium models, prices are endogenous. The model is run recursively dynamic with a 10 year time step, along a baseline going from 2000 to 2030. The model is solved using a linear programming simplex solver and can be run on a personal computer with the GAMS software.
   
A grid cell structure
----
All supply-side data are implemented in the model at the level of gridcell-based Simulation Units (Skalsky, Tarasovicova et al. 2008). In total, 212,707 Simulation Units are delineated by clustering 5 x 5 minutes of arc pixels according to five criteria: altitude, slope, and soil class, 0.5 x 0.5 degrees grid, and the country boundaries. For the present study, in order to ease computation time with the livestock module, the input datasets and the model resolution were agregated to 2 x 2 degree cells disaggregated only by country boundaries and by three agro-ecological zones used in the livestock production system classification: arid, humid, temperate and tropical highlands. This led to a total of 10,894 different Supply Units.

Agricultural production
----
GLOBIOM explicitly covers production of each of the 18 world major crops representing more than 70% of the total harvested area and 85% of the vegetal calorie supply as reported by FAOSTAT. Each crop can be produced under different management systems depending on their relative profitability: subsistence, low input rainfed, high input rainfed, and high input irrigated, when water resources are available. For each of the four systems, crop yields are calculated at the Simulation Unit level on the basis of soil, slope, altitude and climate information, using the EPIC model (Williams and Singh 1995). Within each management system, input structure is fixed following a Leontieff production function. But crop yields can change in reaction to external socio-economic drivers through switch to another management system or reallocation of the production to a more or less productive Supply Unit. Besides the endogennous mechanisms, an exogenous component representing longterm technological change is also considered. The livestock sector - the key component of this paper - is presented separately in section 2.

Forestry
----
The forestry sector is represented in GLOBIOM with five categories of primary products (pulp logs, saw logs, biomass for energy, traditional fuel wood, and other industrial logs) which are consumed by industrial energy, cooking fuel demand, or processed and sold on the market as final products (wood pulp and sawnwood). These products are supplied from managed forests and short rotation plantations. Harvesting cost and mean annual increments are informed by the G4M global forestry model (Kindermann, Obersteiner et al. 2006) which in turn calculates them based on thinning strategies and length of the rotation period.

Land use change
----
The model optimizes over six land cover types: cropland, grassland, short rotation plantations, managed forests, unmanaged forests and other natural land. Economic activities are associated with the first four land cover types. There are other three land cover types represented in the model: other agricultural land, wetlands, and not relevant (bare areas, water bodies, snow and ice, and artificial surfaces). These three categories are currently kept constant. Each Simulation Unit can contain the nine land cover types. The base year spatial distribution of land cover is based on the Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000). However, as any other global dataset of this type, GLC2000 suffers from large uncertainty (Fritz, See et al. 2011). Therefore auxiliary datasets and procedures are used to transform this “raw” data into a consistent dataset corresponding to the model needs. An example of such a transformation is presented in section 2.4 concerning grasslands.

   Land cover representation in GLOBIOM and the matrix of endogenous land cover change possibilities (Havlík et al., 2014 :cite:`havlik_climate_2014`).

Land conversion over the simulation period is endogenously determined for each Supply Unit within the available land resources. Such conversion implies a conversion cost – increasing with the area of land converted - that is taken into account in the producer optimization behavior. Land conversion possibilities are further restricted through biophysical land suitability and production potentials, and through a matrix of potential land cover transitions (Fig. 1). 

Food demand
----
Food demand is in GLOBIOM endogenous and depends on population, gross domestic product (GDP) and own produt price. Population and GDP are exogenous variables while prices are endogenous. The simple demand system is presented in Eq. 1. First, for each product i in region r and period t,  the prior demand quantity Q ̅ is calculated as a function of population POP, GDP per capita 〖GDP〗^cap adjusted by the income elasticity ε^GDP, and the base year consumption level as reported in the Food Balance Sheets of FAOSTAT. If the prior demand quantity could be satisfied at the base year price P ̅, this would be also the optimal demand quantity Q. However, usually the optimal quantity will be different from the prior quantity, and will depend on the optimal price P and the price elasticity ε^price, the latter calculated from USDA (Seale, Regmi et al. 2003), updated in (Muhammad, Seale et al. 2011) for the base year 2000. Because food demand in developed countries is more inelastic than in developing ones, the value of this elasticity is assumed to decrease with the level of GDP per capita. The rule we apply is that the price elasticity of developing countries converges to the price elasticity of the USA in 2000 at the same pace as their GDP per capita reach the USA GDP per capita value of 2000. This allows us to capture the effect of change in relative prices on food consumption taking into account heterogeneity of responses across regions, products and over time.

Our demand function has the virtue of being easy to linearize which allows us to solve GLOBIOM as a linear program. This is currently necessary because of the size of the model and the current performance of non-linear solvers. However, this demand function has although some limitations which need to be kept in mind when considering the results obtained with respect to climate change mitigation and food availability. One of them is that we do not consider direct substitution effects on the consumer side which could be captured through cross price demand elasticities. Such a demand representation could lead to increased consumption of some products like legumes or cereals when prices of GHG intensive products like rice or beef would go up as a consequence of a carbon price targeting emissions for the agricultural sector. Neglecting the direct substitution effects may lead to an overestimation of the negative impact of such mitigation policies on total food consumption. However, the effect on emissions would be only of second order, because consumption would increase for commodities the least affected by the carbon price, and hence the least emission intensive. Although we do not represent the direct substitution effects on the demand side, substitution can still occur due to changes in prices on the supply side and can in some cases lead to a partial compensation of the decreased demand for commodities affected the most by a mitigation policy. This phenomenon can be observed in our results for mitigation policies targeting the livestock sector only (Fig. 4. In the main text). 

Livestock data
====

Livestock population
The principal variable characterizing the livestock production in GLOBIOM is the number of animals by species, production system and production type in each Simulation Unit. We differentiate four species aggregates: cattle and buffaloes (bovines), sheep and goats (small ruminants), pigs, and poultry. Eight production systems are specified for ruminants: grazing systems in arid (LGA), humid (LGH) and temperate/highland areas (LGT); mixed systems in arid (MXA), humid (MXH) and temperate/highland areas (MXT); urban systems (URB); and other systems (OTH). Mixed systems are an aggregate of the more detailed original Seré and Steinfeld’s classes (Seré and Steinfeld 1996) – mixed rainfed and mixed irrigated. Two production systems are specified for monogastrics: smallholders (SMH) and industrial systems (IND). In terms of production type, dairy and meat herds are modeled separately for ruminants: dairy herd includes adult females and replacement heifers, whose diets are distinguished. Poultry in smallholder systems is considered as mixed producer of meat and eggs, and poultry in industrial systems is split into laying hens and broilers, with differentiated diet regimes. Overall livestock numbers at the country level are, where possible while respecting minimum herd dynamics rules, harmonized with FAOSTAT. 

The spatial distribution of ruminants and their allocation between production systems follows an updated version of Wint and Robinson (Wint and Robinson 2007). Since we do not have better information, we assume that the share of dairy and meat herds within one region is the same in all production systems. The share is obtained from the FAO country level data about milk producing animals and total herd size. Monogastrics are not treated in a spatially explicit way since no reliable maps are currently available, and because monogastrics are not linked in the model to specific spatial features, like grasslands. The split between smallholder and industrial systems follows Herrero et al. (Herrero, Havlik et al. forthcoming).

Livestock products
----
Each livestock category is characterized by product yield, feed requirements, and a set of direct GHG emission coefficients. On the output side, seven products are defined: bovine meat and milk, small ruminant meat and milk, pig meat, poultry meat, and eggs. For each region, production type and production system, individual productivities are determined.

Bovine and small ruminant productivities are estimated through the RUMINANT model (Herrero, Thornton et al. 2008, Herrero, Havlik et al. forthcoming), in a three steps process which consists of first, specifying a plausible feed ration; second, calculating in RUMINANT the corresponding yield; and finally confronting at the region level with FAOSTAT (Supply Utilization Accounts) data on production. These three steps were repeated in a loop until a match with the statistical data was obtained. Monogastrics productivities were disaggregated from FAOSTAT based on assumptions about potential productivities and the relative differences in productivities between smallholder and industrial systems. The full detail of this procedure is provided in Herrero et al. (Herrero, Havlik et al. forthcoming).

Final livestock products are expressed in primary commodity equivalents. Each product is considered as a differentiated good with a specific market except for bovine and small ruminant milk that are merged in a single milk market. The two milk types are therefore treated as perfect substitutes.

Livestock feed
----
As mentioned above feed requirements for ruminants are computed simultaneously with the yields (Herrero, Havlik et al. forthcoming). Specific diets are defined for the adult dairy females, and for the other animals. The feed requirements are first calculated at the level of four aggregates – grains (concentrates), stover, grass, and other. When estimating the feed-yield couples, the RUMINANT model takes into account different qualities of these aggregates across regions and systems. Feed requirements for monogastrics are at this level determined through literature review presented in Herrero et al. (Herrero, Havlik et al. forthcoming). In general, it is assumed that in industrial systems pigs and poultry consume 10 and 12 kg dry matter of concentrates per TLU and day, respectively, and concentrates are the only feed sources. Smallholder animals get only one quarter of the amount of grains fed in industrial systems, the rest is supposed to come from other sources, like household waste, not explicitly represented in GLOBIOM.

The aggregate GRAINS input group is harmonized with feed quantities as reported at the country level in Commodity Balances of FAOSTAT. The harmonization proceeds in two steps, where first, GRAINS in the feed rations are adjusted so that total feed requirements at the country level match with total feed quantity in Commodity Balances, and second, “Grains” is disaggregated into 11 feed groups: Barley, Corn, Pulses, Rice, Sorghum & Millet, Soybeans, Wheat, Cereal Other, Oilseed Other, Crops Other, Animal Products. The adjustment of total GRAINS quantities is first done through shifts between the GRAINS and OTHER categories in ruminant systems. Hence, if total GRAINS are lower than the statistics, a part or total feed from the OTHER category is moved to GRAINS. If this is not enough, all GRAINS requirements of ruminants are shifted up in the same proportions. If total GRAINS are higher than the statistics, first we reallocate a part of them to the OTHER category. If this is not enough, we keep our values, which then results in higher GRAINS demand than reported in FAOSTAT. This inconsistency is overcome in GLOBIOM, by creating a “reserve” of the missing GRAINS. This reserve is in simulations kept constant, thus it enables to reproduce the base year activity levels mostly consistent with FAOSTAT, but requires that all additional GRAINS demand arising over the simulation horizon is satisfied from real production. The decomposition of GRAINS into the 11 subcategories has to follow predefined minima and maxima of the shares of feedstuffs in a ration differentiated by species and region. At the same time, the shares of the feedstuffs corresponding to country level statistics need to be respected. This problem is solved as minimization of the square deviations from the prescribed minimum and maximum limits. In GLOBIOM, the balance between demand and supply of the crop products entering the GRAINS subcategories needs to be satisfied at regional level. Substitution ratios are defined for the byproducts of biofuel industry so that they can also enter the feed supply.

STOVER is supposed less mobile than GRAINS, therefore we force stover demand in GLOBIOM to match supply at grid level. The demand is mostly far below the stover availability. In the cells where this is not the case, the same system of reserve is implemented as for the grains. No adjustments are done to the feed rations as such.

There are unfortunately no worldwide statistics available on either consumption or production of grass. Hence we had to rely for grass requirements entirely on the values calculated with RUMINANT, and use them to estimate the grassland extent and productivity. This procedure is described in the next section.

Finally, the feed aggregate OTHER is represented in a simplified way, where it is assumed that it is satisfied entirely from a reserve in the base year, and all additional demand needs to be satisfied by forage production on grasslands.
