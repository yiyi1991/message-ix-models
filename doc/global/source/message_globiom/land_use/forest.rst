Forestry
====

The forestry sector is represented in GLOBIOM with five categories of primary products (pulp logs, saw logs, biomass for energy, traditional fuel wood, and other industrial logs) which are consumed by industrial energy, cooking fuel demand, or processed and sold on the market as final products (wood pulp and sawnwood). These products are supplied from managed forests and short rotation plantations. Harvesting cost and mean annual increments are informed by the G4M global forestry model (Kindermann, Obersteiner et al. 2006 :cite:`kindermann_predicting_2006`) which in turn calculates them based on thinning strategies and length of the rotation period.
