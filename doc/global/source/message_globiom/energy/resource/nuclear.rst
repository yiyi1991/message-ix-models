Nuclear Resources
======================

Estimates of available uranium resources in the literature vary considerably, which could become relevant if advanced nuclear fuel cycles (e.g., the plutonium cycle including fast breeder reactors, the thorium cycle) are not available. In MESSAGE advanced nuclear cycles such as the plutonium cycle and nuclear fuel reprocessing are in principle represented, but their availability varies following the scenario narrative. :numref:`fig-uran` below shows the levels of uranium resources assumed available in recent MESSAGE scenarios, building upon the Global Energy Assessment scenarios. These span a considerable range of the estimates in the literature, but at the same time none of them fall at the extreme ends of the spectrum (see Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`, Section 7.5.2 for a more detailed discussion of uranium resources). Nuclear resources and fuel cycle (if available) are modeled at the global level, which is compatible with the notion of the nuclear fuel cycle being under international control.
