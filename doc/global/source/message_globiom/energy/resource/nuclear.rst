Nuclear Resources
======================

Estimates of available uranium resources in the literature vary considerably, which could become relevant if advanced nuclear fuel cycles (e.g., the plutonium cycle including fast breeder 
reactors, the thorium cycle) are not available. In MESSAGE-GLOBIOM advanced nuclear cycles such as the plutonium cycle and nuclear fuel reprocessing are in principle represented, but their 
availability varies following the scenario narrative. :numref:`fig-uran` below shows the levels of uranium resources assumed available in MESSAGE-GLOBIOM scenarios, building upon the 
Global Energy Assessment scenarios (see Riahi et al., 2012 :cite:`riahi_chapter_2012`). These span a considerable range of the estimates in the literature, but at the same time none of 
them fall at the extreme ends of the spectrum (see Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`, Section 7.5.2 for a more detailed discussion of uranium resources). Nuclear resources 
and fuel cycle are modeled at the global level.
