Technological change
======================
Technological change in MESSAGE is generally treated exogenously, although pioneering work on the endogenization of technological change in energy-engineering type models has been 
done with MESSAGE (Messner, 1997 :cite:`messner_endogenized_1997`). The current cost and performance parameters, including conversion efficiencies and emission coefficients is 
generally derived from the relevant engineering literature. For the future alternative cost and performance projections are usually developed to cover a relatively wide range of 
uncertainties that influences model results to a good extent. 

Technology cost
----------------
The quantitative assumptions about technology cost sdevelopment are derived from the overarching qualitative SSP narratives (cf. section :ref:`narratives`). In SSP1, for instance, whose 
green-growth storyline is more consistent with a sustainable development paradigm, higher rates of technological progress and learning are assumed for renewables and other advanced 
technologies that may replace fossil fuels (e.g., the potential for electric mobility is assumed to be higher in SSP1 compared to SSP2 or SSP3). In contrast, SSP3 assumes limited progress 
across a host of advanced technologies, particularly for renewables and hydrogen; more optimistic assumptions are instead made for 
coal-based technologies, not only for power generation but also for liquid fuels production. Meanwhile, the middle-of-the-road SSP2 narrative is characterized by a fairly balanced view 
of progress for both conventional fossil and non-fossil technologies. In this sense, technological development in SSP2 is not biased toward any particular technology group. If it were, 
it would not occupy a middle-of-the-road position between the green-growth and fossil-fuel intensive paradigms of SSP1 and SSP3, respectively. 

Technological costs vary regionally in all SSPs, reflecting marked differences in engineering and construction costs across countries observed in the real world. Generally, costs start 
out lower in the developing world and are assumed to converge to those of present-day industrialized countries as the former becomes richer throughout the century (thus, the cost 
projections consider both labour and capital components). This catch-up in costs is assumed to be fastest in SSP1 and slowest in SSP3 (where differences remain, even in 2100); SSP2 is in 
between. Estimates for present-day and fully learned-out technology costs are from the Global Energy Assessment (Riahi et al., 2012 :cite:`riahi_chapter_2012`) and World Energy Outlook 
(IEA, 2014). A summary of these cost assumptions can be found in sections :ref:`electricity` and :ref:`other`.


Technology diffusion
---------------------
MESSAGE tracks investments by vintage, an important feature to represent the inertia in the energy system due to its long-lived capital stock. In case of shocks 
(e.g., introduction of stringent climate policy), it is however possible to prematurely retire existing capital stock such as power plants or other energy conversion 
technologies and switch to more suitable alternatives.

An important factor in this context that influences technology adoption in MESSAGE are technology diffusion constraints. Technology diffusion in MESSAGE is constrained 
by dynamic constraints that relate the construction of a technology added or the activity (level of production) of a technology in a period t to construction or the 
activity in the previous period t-1 (Messner and Strubegger, 1995 :cite:`messner_users_1995`, cf. sections :ref:`upper_dynamic_constraint_capacity` and :ref:`upper_dynamic_constraint_activity`). 

While limiting the possibility of flip-flop behavior as it is frequently observed in unconstrained Linear Programming (LP) models such as MESSAGE, a drawback of such hard 
growth constraints is that the relative advantage of some technology over another technology is not taken into account and therefore even for very competitive technologies, 
no acceleration of technology diffusion is possible. In response to this limitation, so called flexible or soft dynamic constraints have been introduced into MESSAGE 
(Keppo and Strubegger, 2010 :cite:`keppo_short_2010`). These allow faster technology diffusion at additional costs and therefore generate additional model flexibility 
while still reducing the flip-flop behavior and sudden penetration of technologies.

:numref:`fig-difconstraint` below illustrates the maximum technology growth starting at a level of 1 in year t=0 for a set of five diffusion constraints which jointly lead to a soft constraint.

**TO BE PASSED TO ANNEX:**

An important factor in this context that influences technology adoption in MESSAGE are technology diffusion constraints. Technology diffusion in MESSAGE is constraint by dynamic
constraints that relate the activity a (level of production) in a period t to the activity in the previous period t-1 (Messner and Strubegger, 1995 :cite:`messner_users_1995`). 
Two parameters, an annual increment or startup value s and an annual growth rate r are used to parameterize these dynamic growth constraints. For a period length of one year, the following
equation describes the dynamic constraints:

Without the startup value s, a technology with a zero activity level in year t-1 would not be able to ever reach a non-zero deployment levels, i.e. a non-zero startup value allows the technology to start growing from zero which would not be possible with a purely exponential growth relationship. Therefore, the value of s governs the technology growth during the early stages of entering the market while the growth rates r predominantly constrain the annual growth once the initial deployment is over.

For an arbitrary period length of T years, the maximum level of technology activity in period t, at , reads as follows:

with the period increment

To operationalize the concept of soft dynamic constraints, a set of n dummy variables, bi, multiplied by a corresponding growth factor (1+ri)T are added to the dynamic growth constraint in Eq. (1).

The maximum value for these dummy variables bi is limited to the activity of the underlying technology a, i.e.

, for all i .

Therefore, this new formulation increases the highest allowed growth factor from

to

In addition, the objective function value for period t is modified by the extra term

which adds costs ci  per additional growth factor utilized.
