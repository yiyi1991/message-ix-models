A draft proposal for an integrated modeling platform at IIASA  
=============================================================

There is broad consensus across programs at IIASA that we should strive towards an integrated framework
for handling reference data, model input data, and model results. This framework should follow 
academic best-practice, including version control, standardized methods for read/write across 
standard script languages (in particular R and Python), etc.
