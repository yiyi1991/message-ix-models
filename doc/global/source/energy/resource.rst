Fossil Fuel Reserves and Resources
----------------------------------

.. todo:: Content in :ref:`fossilfuel` is largely similar to this, with some differences. Preserve any key text, then delete this page.

:numref:`tab-global-ff-res` shows the assumed total quantities of fossil fuel resources in the MESSAGE model for the base year 2005. :numref:`fig-supply` gives these resource estimates as supply curves.
In addition, the assumptions are compared with estimates from the Global Energy Assessment (Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`) as of the year 2009. Estimating fossil fuel reserves
is built on both economic and technological assumptions. With an improvement in technology or a change in purchasing power, the amount that may be considered a “reserve” vs. a “resource”
(generically referred to here as resources) can actually vary quite widely.

The following table (:numref:`tab-ffavail`) presents the fossil resource availability in ZJ (2010-2100) for coal, oil and gas, for SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3, respectively.

Coal is the largest resource among fossil fuels; it accounts for more than 50% of total fossil reserve+resource estimates even at the higher end of the assumptions, which includes considerable amounts of unconventional hydrocarbons. Oil is the most vulnerable fossil fuel at less than 10 ZJ of conventional oil and possibly less than 10 ZJ of unconventional oil. Natural gas is more abundant in both the conventional and unconventional categories.

Conventional oil and gas are distributed unevenly throughout the world, with only a few regions dominating the reserves. Nearly half of the reserves of conventional oil is found in Middle East and North Africa, and close to 40% of conventional gas is found in the Former Soviet Union. Coal shows much more geographical diversity: the Former Soviet Union, Pacific OECD, North America, and Centrally Planned Asia and China all possess more than 10 ZJ of reserves.

Similar to conventional oil, much of the unconventional oil resides in the Middle East and North Africa. However, with North America and Latin America showing wide ranges in the unconventional oil estimate, the share of Middle East and North Africa could be high as 42% or as low as 24%. Meanwhile, unconventional gas is distributed quite well throughout the world; North America possesses the most with roughly 25% of the world reserve.

:numref:`fig-supply` presents the cumulative global resource supply curves for coal, oil and gas in the IIASA IAM framework. Green shaded resources are technically and economically extractable in all SSPs, purple shaded resources are additionally available in SSP1 and SSP2 and blue shaded resources are additionally available in SSP2. Coloured vertical lines represent the cumulative use of each resource between 2010 and 2100 in the SSP baselines (see top panel for colour coding), and are thus the result of the combined effect of our assumptions on fossil resource availability and conversion technologies in the SSP baselines. ‘Reserves’ are generally defined as being those quantities for which geological and engineering information indicate with reasonable certainty that they can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. ‘Resources’ are detected quantities that cannot be profitably recovered with current technology, but might be recoverable in the future, as well as those quantities that are geologically possible, but yet to be found. The remainder are ‘Undiscovered resources’ and, by definition, one can only speculate on their existence. Definitions are based on Rogner et al. (2012) :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`.
