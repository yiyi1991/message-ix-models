Fossil Fuel Reserves and Resources
---------------------------------------------
:numref:`tab-globff` shows the assumed total quantities of fossil fuel resources in the MESSAGE model for the base year 2005. :numref:`fig-supply` gives these resource estimates as supply curves. 
In addition, the assumptions are compared with estimates from the Global Energy Assessment (Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`) as of the year 2009. Estimating fossil fuel reserves 
is built on both economic and technological assumptions. With an improvement in technology or a change in purchasing power, the amount that may be considered a “reserve” vs. a “resource” 
(generically referred to here as resources) can actually vary quite widely.

Coal is the largest resource among fossil fuels; it accounts for more than 50% of total fossil reserve+resource estimates even at the higher end of the assumptions, which includes considerable amounts of unconventional hydrocarbons. Oil is the most vulnerable fossil fuel at less than 10 ZJ of conventional oil and possibly less than 10 ZJ of unconventional oil. Natural gas is more abundant in both the conventional and unconventional categories.

Conventional oil and gas are distributed unevenly throughout the world, with only a few regions dominating the reserves. Nearly half of the reserves of conventional oil is found in Middle East and North Africa, and close to 40% of conventional gas is found in the Former Soviet Union. Coal shows much more geographical diversity: the Former Soviet Union, Pacific OECD, North America, and Centrally Planned Asia and China all possess more than 10 ZJ of reserves.

Similar to conventional oil, much of the unconventional oil resides in the Middle East and North Africa. However, with North America and Latin America showing wide ranges in the unconventional oil estimate, the share of Middle East and North Africa could be high as 42% or as low as 24%. Meanwhile, unconventional gas is distributed quite well throughout the world; North America possesses the most with roughly 25% of the world reserve.

:numref:`fig-supply` presents the cumulative global resource supply curves for coal, oil and gas in the IIASA IAM framework. Green shaded resources are technically and economically extractable in all SSPs, purple shaded resources are additionally available in SSP1 and SSP2 and blue shaded resources are additionally available in SSP2. Coloured vertical lines represent the cumulative use of each resource between 2010 and 2100 in the SSP baselines (see top panel for colour coding), and are thus the result of the combined effect of our assumptions on fossil resource availability and conversion technologies in the SSP baselines. ‘Reserves’ are generally defined as being those quantities for which geological and engineering information indicate with reasonable certainty that they can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. ‘Resources’ are detected quantities that cannot be profitably recovered with current technology, but might be recoverable in the future, as well as those quantities that are geologically possible, but yet to be found. The remainder are ‘Undiscovered resources’ and, by definition, one can only speculate on their existence. Definitions are based on Rogner et al. (2012) :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`.

Nuclear Resources
-------------------

Estimates of available uranium resources in the literature vary considerably, which could become relevant if advanced nuclear fuel cycles (e.g., the plutonium cycle including fast breeder 
reactors, the thorium cycle) are not available. In MESSAGE-GLOBIOM advanced nuclear cycles such as the plutonium cycle and nuclear fuel reprocessing are in principle represented, but their 
availability varies following the scenario narrative. :numref:`fig-uran` below shows the levels of uranium resources assumed available in MESSAGE-GLOBIOM scenarios, building upon the 
Global Energy Assessment scenarios (see Riahi et al., 2012 :cite:`riahi_chapter_2012`). These span a considerable range of the estimates in the literature, but at the same time none of 
them fall at the extreme ends of the spectrum (see Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`, Section 7.5.2 for a more detailed discussion of uranium resources). Nuclear resources 
and fuel cycle are modeled at the global level.

Renewable Resources
------------------------------
:numref:`tab-depl` shows the assumed total potentials of renewable energy deployment (by resource type) in the MESSAGE model. In addition, the assumptions are compared with technical 
potential estimates from the Global Energy Assessment (Rogner et al., 2012 :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`). In this context, it is important to note that typical MESSAGE scenarios do not consider 
the full technical potential of renewable energy resources, but rather only a subset of those potentials, owing to additional constraints (e.g., sustainability criteria, technology diffusion
and systems integration issues, and other economic considerations) that may not be fully captured within the model. These constraints may lead to a significant reduction of the technical potential.

*Notes: MESSAGE-GLOBIOM renewable energy potentials are based on Pietzcker et al. (2014)* :cite:`pietzcker_solar_2014`, *Eurek et al. (in review)* :cite:`eurek_wind_2016`, *Christiansson (1995)* :cite:`christiansson_diffusion_1995`, *and Rogner et al (2012)* :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012`. *The potentials for non-combustible renewable energy sources are specified in terms of the electricity or heat that can be produced by specific technologies (i.e., from a secondary energy perspective). By contrast, the technical potentials from* :cite:`rogner_chapter_2012` *refer to the flows of energy that could become available as inputs for technology conversion. So for example, the technical potential for wind is given as the kinetic energy available for wind power generation, whereas the deployment potential would only be the electricity that could be generated by the wind turbines.*

Regional resource potentials for solar and wind are classified according to resource quality (annual capacity factor) based on Pietzcker et al. (2014, :cite:`pietzcker_solar_2014`) and 
Eurek et al. (in review, :cite:`eurek_wind_2016`). Regional resource potentials as implemented into MESSAGE-GLOBIOM are provided by region and capacity factor for solar PV, concentrating solar 
power (CSP), and onshore/offshore wind in Johnson et al. (in review, :cite:`johnson_vre_2016`). The physical potential of these sources is assumed to be the same across all SSPs. However, 
the part of the resource that is useable at economically competitive costs is assumed to differ widely (see Section :ref:`electricity`).

Biomass energy is another potentially important renewable energy resource in the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model, including both commercial and traditional use. Commercial refers to the use of 
bioenergy in, for example, power plants or biofuel refineries, while traditional refers to the use of bioenergy for residential heating and cooking, primarily in rural households of 
today’s developing countries. Bioenergy potentials differ across SSPs as a result of different levels of competition over land for food and fibre, but ultimately only vary to a limited 
degree (:numref:`fig-beavail`). The drivers underlying this competition are different land-use developments in the SSPs, which are determined by agricultural productivity and global 
demand for food consumption.

   Availability of bioenergy at different price levels in the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model for the three SSPs. * typically non-commercial biomass is not traded or sold, however in some cases there is a market – prices range from 0.1-1.5$/GJ (Pachauri et al., 2013 :cite:`pachauri_pathways_2013`) ($ equals 2005 USD).
