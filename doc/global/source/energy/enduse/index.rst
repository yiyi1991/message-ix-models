Energy end-use
=================
MESSAGEix distinguishes three energy end-use sectors, i.e. transport, residential/commercial (also referred to as the buildings sector) and industry. Given the long-term nature of the scenarios, the model version used for the SSPs, represents these end-use sectors in a stylized way. For more detailed short-term analysis, a model version with a more detailed transport sector module that distinguishes different transport modes, vehicle classes amd consumer types exists (McCollum et al., 2016 :cite:`mccollum_transport_2016`).
