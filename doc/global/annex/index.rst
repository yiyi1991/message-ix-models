Annex: mathematical formulation
*******************************

This mathematical formulation of MESSAGE-GLOBIOM relies on the generalized MESSAGEix energy model framework.
See the :ref:`MESSAGEix documentation <message_ix:core>` for a complete description of its formulation.
The equation system of the older MESSAGE V implementation can be found in the `2017 release
<https://docs.messageix.org/projects/global/en/v2017/annex/>`_ of this documentation.
