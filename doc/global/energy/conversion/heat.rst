Heat
==========
A number centralized district heating technologies based on fossil and renewable energy sources are represented in MESSAGE (see :numref:`tab-heat`). Similar to coupled heat and power (CHP) technologies that are described in the :ref:`electricity` sector, these heating plants feed low temperature heat into the district heating system that is then used in the end-use sectors. In addition, there are (decentralized) heat generation options in the :ref:`industrial` and :ref:`resid_commerc`.
