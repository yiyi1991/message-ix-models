Land-Use Emulator
-----------------

The land-use emulator refers to a set of land-use scenarios, provided by GLOBIOM, which are integrated into MESSAGE using a didicated set of equations (add reference to land-use relevant code documentation).  Each land-use scenario represents a combination of biomass potential (for use in the energy sector) and a carbon price.  Each land-use scenario therefore represents a disctinct land-use development pathway.
